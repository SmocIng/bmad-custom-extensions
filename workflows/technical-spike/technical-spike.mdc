description: "Create a technical spike to validate high-risk technical areas (LLM integration, performance, state management, etc.) before architecture design. This workflow helps identify technical risks early and validate feasibility of technical approaches."
author: "BMad Custom"

# Important: This workflow should be executed in Phase 2.5 (between Planning and Solutioning) or before Phase 3.
# It validates technical risks early to prevent implementation issues.
